<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Impatience, Carelessness, Delays Frustration</h4>
<p>Impatience and reckless behaviour can bring a loss of control. There are times to be cautious. Think thru each step. Are you feeling anger at obstacles? Are you rushing at something? Don't do something regretful. Are you able to control your own situation? Steer clear of the caveats. Let people come to themselves before you interact fully. Do not react instantly to things that happen. Give yourself time to lead. Step into the lightness. Be firm in saying no to things you can't take on. Share with care. This time will soon pass. Declutteer!</p>
