<h1>Six of Cups</h1>
<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>Rewriting Past, Innocence, Joy, Familiarity</h4>
<p>Are you feeling nostalgic? It's play time! Take a stroll down memory lane and visit all your favorite things. Find comfort and safety in familiarity. Responsibilities will get heavier as you get older. Try to see your world in a new way. Be playful, spontaneous, creative!</p>
<p>You are being yourself the most when you are being silly!</p>
<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Rose-Colored Glasses, Idealistic</h4>
<ol>
<li>If you live in the past, you miss the joy right in front of you.</li>
<li>Stop thinking about what 'should' be. Focus on now. Move towards action.</li>
<li>Tend to your own needs like a child. Process your pain with compassion towards your self.</li>
<li>Be proud of your whole self, flaws and all. Your past established ideas can prohibit real progress.</li>
<li>Are you becoming boring or repetitive? Find new interests or rot!</li>
<li>Stop living in protectionism. Put yourself in a new situation and experiment from there.</li>
</ol>
