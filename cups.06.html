<h1>Six of Cups</h1>

<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>Rewriting Past, Innocence, Joy, Familiarity</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Responsibilities will increase as you age. Find joy in the present moment.</li>
	<li>Find that thing in your world that brings a smile. Childlike fixation could bring happiness.</li>
	<li>Are you able to feel provided for? By what, whom or how? Can you live in that provision?</li>
	<li>Each person I love and share my inner being with shows another side of the universe's glory.</li>
	<li>In some way, symbolically or ritually, honor past treasures that made you what you are.</li>
	<li>Whisper a kind goodbye to what once was and cleanse yourself for what will be.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Rose-Colored Glasses, Idealistic</h4>
<ol>
<li>If you live in the past, you miss the joy right in front of you.</li>
<li>Stop thinking about what 'should' be. Focus on now. Move towards action.</li>
<li>Tend to your own needs like a child. Process your pain with compassion towards your self.</li>
<li>Be proud of your whole self, flaws and all. Your past established ideas can prohibit real progress.</li>
<li>Are you becoming boring or repetitive? Find new interests or rot!</li>
<li>Stop living in protectionism. Put yourself in a new situation and experiment from there.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Quotes</h3>
<p>You are being yourself the most when you are being silly!</p>
