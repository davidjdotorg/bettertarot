<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>Conventional, Institutional, Tradition</h4>
<p>You have it in you to honor your own traditions. The following of rituals can help you feel grounded. Keep working on what matters to you while building your support group. People upset by your boundaries show why you need them. Who are you truly aligned with? When you do what is expected of you, you prove what you can contain, and are ready to grow into a bigger version of yourself. There is always room for a new mentor or guide to help you expand.</p>

<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Rebel, Maverick, Confinement</h4>
<p>Let your rebellion roar! Chooses your own way, regardless of support. Watch out for controlling people. You are your own teacher. Learn from within. Now is the time. Stop looking for external approval to succeed. Make your own rules. Autopilot and 'following the crowd' days are over.</p>
