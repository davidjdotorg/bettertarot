<h1>King of Wands</h1>
<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>Natural Leader, Visionary</h4>
<p>Lead your life with intent and vision. Be able to both lead and follow, delegating while working alongside. Make it your wish to empower those around you. Grab the vision regardless of its source. Are you just talk? Be action! Changing paths is not a failure as long as the journey continues. Bring others with you.</p>
<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Shrewd, Dictatorial, Domineer</h4>
<p>Don't take people for granted while pursuing your goal. Maintaining healthy relationships must be part of your vision. Don't be rash or hasty. Watch the line between assertive and aggressive. Be aware of people like this! Are you setting realistic goals for yourself? Not everyone has the same drive.</p>
