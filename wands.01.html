<h1>Ace of Wands</h1>
<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>Illumination, Inspiration, Potential</h4>
<p>Step into your personal power! Unapologetically and rampantly chase down your dreams. Experience fiery ambitions that push you to the next level. Plant the seeds now that move you towards your best self! Consider what could be the next breakthru... Are you picking something up or putting something down? Take your fickleness as an opportunity to pursue and complete one single thing! Consider this your gentle nudge that you needed to start your next big idea. Listen to that podcast, stare at the clouds, play or hear music! A simple adventure helps plan the big ones. Actions give you answers that words don't.</p>
<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Vague, Ambiguous, Weighted Down</h4>
<p>When everything feels cloudy, it's time to be patient. Too many choices and possible paths can be exhausting. It can be very hard for me to know what I want. And easy for that 'want' to change. When I prioritize my passions, I prioritize myself. Take a step back and be sure of a lesser path forward. Timing matters Patience pays.</p>
