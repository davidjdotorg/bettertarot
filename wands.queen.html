<h1>Queen of Wands</h1>
<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>Vivacious, Dynamic, Authentic</h4>
<p>Get things done! Find the authentic you and be it! You ARE upbeat! Be courageous and determined. Be friendly and optimistic. Lead a full life everyday. Make Connections. Use opportunities now to shine and to show others how inspiring and confident you can be. You should have so much confidence that it flows over into other people.</p>
<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Intrusive, Contentious, Dejection</h4>
<p>The fire and spark that used to inspire you is dimmed and you have temporarily lost your identity. Take a moment to remember where your passions lie and connect back with that voice. Return to your truth with integrity, grace and ease. You are self-respecting and confident. Success is there. High demands can stoke huge fires. Rebuild your resilience. Express the you YOU are. Restore faith in yourself. You are the real deal. Check your self-respect and confidence level. Be clear with your personal truths. Live in your vision of success.</p>
