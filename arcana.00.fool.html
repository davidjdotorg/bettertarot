					<h4>Free Spirit, Purity, Beginning</h4>
					<p>Now is the time to discover yourself! The journey awaits. Let go! Release any expectations of what the journey will be so you can truly experience it. There is unlimited potential when first starting out. Trust in the lesson of a new journey no matter how it might end. What are you anxious over? To listen to yourself you must believe in and trust yourself. Fixate on wonder and awe and prepare to explore. The future forces unawareness. Embrace the unknown without fear! Seek out the fools around you. Recognize suffering, then set it down. No suffering will be necessary on this journey! It is not foolish to trust in what you know you know.</p>

					<h3>Negative</h3>
					<h4>Holding Back, Risks</h4>
					<p>When you sense that the timing isn't right, really dig into why. There may be a good reason to be cautious right now but it's important you know what it is. Slowing down is still moving forward. Are you resisting and preventing without reason? Or have you reasonably considered the risks? Take this time to think and evaluate. Feel risk personally and build your strengths on what you know. Remain optimistic, yet grounded.</p>

					<p>The fool is the essence of potential, unbound by past experiences or future expectations.</p>
