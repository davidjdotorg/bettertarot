					<h3>Positive</h3>
					<h4>Disappointment, Withdrawal, Escapism</h4>
					<p>
						Reorganize your external environment to reflect your internal desires. Realize what you already have.
						Renouncing the world does not mean having nothing. It means your soul is not possessed by your surroundings.
						This may be the time to leave a disappointing situation, but never a disappointing person.
						There may be sadness when saying goodbye. But still say it.
						Pretending to sleep may bring sleep but pretending to be happy will not bring happiness.
						Ask yourself "How does this serve my higher good?"

					<h3>Negative</h3>
					<h4>Avoidance, Indecision, Fear of Loss</h4>
					<p>
						Having lots of options can make it harder to pick just one. Don't let perfect be the enemy of good.
						Avoidance can lead to aimlessness. Revive a sense of belonging thru a human connection.
						Don't be afraid to walk away from something. It is a sign of respect to yourself.
						You have to be true to yourself to find a lifestyle that fits you. Otherwise, your stress will increase.
						If you recognize your own bondage, do you recognize if it feels comfortable? Is your comfort zone your shackle?
						Lose the things, find the people. Commit yourself to walking toward those you love.

				<p>Focus more on your desire than on your doubt, and the dream will take care of itself. - Marcia Wieder</p>
				<p>Pretending to sleep may bring sleep but pretending to be happy will not bring happiness.</p>
				<p>Letting go means coming to the realization that some people are part of your history, but not part of your destiny.</p>
				<p>You are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream.</p>
				<p>Don't let yesterday take up too much of today. - Will Rogers</p>
				<p>You can't start the next chapter of your life by re-reading the last one.</p>
				<p>Your life does not get better by chance.  It gets better by change. - Rohn</p>
				<p>We must be willing to let go of the life we planned so as to have the life that is waiting for us.</p>
				<p>The process of letting go is difficult, but it makes space for something meaningful and fulfilling to come into your life.</p>
