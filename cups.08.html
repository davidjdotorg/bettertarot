<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>Disappointment, Withdrawal, Escapism</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Reorganize your external environment to reflect your internal desires. Realize what you already have.</li>
	<li>Renouncing the world does not mean having nothing. It means your soul is not possessed by your surroundings.</li>
	<li>This may be the time to leave a disappointing situation, but never a disappointing person.</li>
	<li>There may be sadness when saying goodbye. But still say it.</li>
	<li>Pretending to sleep may bring sleep but pretending to be happy will not bring happiness.</li>
	<li>Ask yourself "How does this serve my higher good?"</li>
</ol>

<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Avoidance, Indecision, Fear of Loss</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Having lots of options can make it harder to pick just one. Don't let perfect be the enemy of good.</li>
	<li>Avoidance can lead to aimlessness. Revive a sense of belonging thru a human connection.</li>
	<li>Don't be afraid to walk away from something. It is a sign of respect to yourself.</li>
	<li>You have to be true to yourself to find a lifestyle that fits you. Otherwise, your stress will increase.</li>
	<li>If you recognize your own bondage, do you recognize if it feels comfortable? Is your comfort zone your shackle?</li>
	<li>Lose the things, find the people. Commit yourself to walking toward those you love.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Quotes</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Focus more on your desire than on your doubt, and the dream will take care of itself. - Marcia Wieder</li>
