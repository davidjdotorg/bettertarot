<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>Clarity, Mental Strength, Cerebral</h4>
<ol>
<li>Are you able to detach yourself from your emotions in order to solve problems using your intellect and objectivity?</li>
<li>Detachment can be necessary to achieve fairness. Sound judgment stems from objectivity.</li>
<li>There are times when you cannot be particularly caring or sympathetic. Logically navigate the path ahead.</li>
<li>Structure allows freedom to flourish. Hold on to your high ethics.</li>
<li>Keep your emotions in check while drawing on your intellect. Lead with a conscious compass.</li>
<li>Back up your beliefs with experience. This is the only way to test for truth.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Mentally Abusive, Power Hungry, Manipulative</h4>
<p>Rationalize your thoughts and use your logic to help you make a decision to take action. Check your aggression level. Do you lack decisiveness? Are you worried? Try to find clarity on the issues and come to a decision. Take that roast out of the oven. Make a stand on your decision, keeping your eyes open. Do all you can to stay calm. Avoid people of aggression.</p>
