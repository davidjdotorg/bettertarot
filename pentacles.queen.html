<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>Nourishment, Earth Mother, Hearth</h4>
<ol>
	<li>You are working to have, so be ready to share. Experience love, comfort, and support.</li>
	<li>Be practical and resourceful in your life. Make a little go a long way.</li>
	<li>Maintain a compassionate, nurturing, practical and down-to-earth attitude when dealing with others and your present circumstances.</li>
	<li>Find time for yourself and prioritize 'me' time in between all your other commitments.</li>
	<li>Be absolutely devoted to the people you most care about.</li>
	<li>Reroll.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Working, Smothering, Isolation</h4>
<p>Take a step back and see where you can spend less time in control. You may be juggling career and home life. You are keen to ensure you can sustain your own lifestyle. You may be tending to yourself or becoming aware you should. Turn your caring energy towards yourself. Then you will be better equipped to take care of others. Where do your priorities lie? Release the desire to be in command. Allow more time for thoughtful solitude. Sit. Nothing else.</p>
