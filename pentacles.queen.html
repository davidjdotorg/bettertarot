	<h4>Queen of Pentacles Quotes</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>I believe depression is legitimate. But I also believe that if you don't exercise, eat nutritious food, get sunlight, get enough sleep, consume positive material, surround yourself with support, then you aren't giving yourself a fighting chance. - Jim Carrey</li>
