<h1>Judgment</h1>
<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>Absolution, Evaluation, Reflection</h4>
<p>You need to regenerate. What patterns from the past aren't working now? Make authenticity important to you. Have you set something down that you need to pick up? Think! How can you use your judgment if you don't stop and think? It is okay to take time and just think on something.</p>
<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Overcritical, Self-Doubt, Self-Refusal</h4>
<p>Plagued with doubt, replaying uncomfortable situations will keep you there. What is really bothering you? Move on with confidence and pride. Your decisions are in your control. Now is not the time to be cautious or introverted! Stop and think about your life so far, then draw from past lessons. The call that you feel on your life will not wane. Face it! Self assess, and speak your truth!</p>
