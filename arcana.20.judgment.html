<h1>Judgment</h1>

<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>Absolution, Evaluation, Reflection</h4>
<p>You need to regenerate. What patterns from the past aren't working now? Make authenticity important to you. Have you set something down that you need to pick up? Think! How can you use your judgment if you don't stop and think? It is okay to take time and just think on something.</p>

<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Overcritical, Self-Doubt, Self-Refusal</h4>
<ol>
	<li>The call that you feel on your life will not wane. Face it, self-assess, and speak your truth.</li>
	<li>If replaying uncomfortable situations does not help resolve them, stop doing it and release yourself.</li>
	<li>If you're not addressing the root of what's bothering you, you are most likely bothering others with your words.</li>
	<li>Introversion and caution is sometimes necessary to avoid harming loved ones when you are feeling unsettled.</li>
	<li>Judgment must rise above the illusion of separation. Know the impact your words can and will carry.</li>
	<li>Discernment requires a willingness to listen openly as neither victim nor oppressor. Ascend!</li>
</ol>

<h3>Quotes</h3>
<p>A beautiful sunset is something that exists; The song of a bird and the blue sky also exist. The paradise of form and colors is always accessible.</p>
