<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>Victory, Validation, Acknowledgement</h4>
<p>You're killing it! There's no stopping this train, accept this as a validation of your path. Maintain perspective and stay grounded because you are flying! You have harnassed your strengths and talents to bring about a successful outcome. Believe in who you are. Do not let fear or guilt stand in the way of your success. Still, reigning in an ego can make a victory even sweeter. Be grateful for the encouragement and inspiration given you along the way.</p>

Be more concerned with your character than with your reputation. Your character is what you really are while your reputation is merely what others think you are. - John Wooden

<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Private Acheivement, Fall From Grace</h4>
<p>What milestones have you reached that you are not sharing? Do you lack confidence? Are you nervous you are being too over the top? Create your own definition of success! Ask yourself "What does success mean to me?" Your values and your priorities are unique to you. If you can clearly define your success, you can make better choices going forward. If your confidence has taken a hit, slow down or stop and remind yourself of who you are. Do you need new surrounding? Is something salvageable? Reigning in your ego can make your success more powerful.</p>
