<h1>King of Cups</h1>
<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>Equilibrium, Mindfulness, Humanity</h4>
<p>Mindfulness is key to making an impact. Carry your emotions with intention, aptitude, and wit. Apply humanity to your thought process. Stay emotionally balanced. Nothing gives a person more advantage than remaining calm.</p>
<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Emotional Abuse, Toxic, Low</h4>
<p>Take action in personal responsibility! Are you processing your emotions or acting needlessly on them? Center yourself, be calm. Prove the balance in your life by being in charge of your self. Avoid victims and manipulation. Is there someone around you punishing you with their moods? Are you the punisher? Be mature and loving! Grow up and come out! See things as they are with loving eyes. Be accountable for your own well-being. You've gotten this far, keep searching for the root cause.</p>
