<h1>Eight of Wands</h1>
<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>Progress, Movement Forward</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Progress is a process where things fall into place.</li>
	<li>I find freedom to move when boundaries are well structured.</li>
	<li>Think -> into -> things! Not just (about) things.</li>
	<li>When you define the process you can see the progress.</li>
	<li>Can you devote yourself to a task? Focus all the energy.</li>
	<li>Accept and adapt to those things that will not change.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Rush, Impatience, Urgency</h4>
<p>Impatience grows as mounting delays prolong you from taking action. Postponement may dampen your spirits. Inaction may result due to fear of not being accepted. Practice patience and breathe. Accept othes as being in their own space. Slow down. Appreciate what you have. Time is constant, your energy is not.</p>
