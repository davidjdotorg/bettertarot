<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>Painful Ending, Loss, Crisis</h4>
<ol>
	<li>If something comes to a painful end, are you positioned to withstand thru the memory of the moments?</li>
	<li>Bring yourself to painful conversations with grace and dignity. Resist not. Facilitate your own renewal by being aware of the process.</li>
	<li>Attacks on your ego should not damage your life philosophies. Live in the inner shell.</li>
	<li>Remember that moment when you thought you had it all together? Can you survive knowing you don't? What is balance?</li>
	<li>Do not give way to thoughts of anger or resentment or things of a lower nature. Your target is not revenge but release.</li>
	<li>Impermanence reminds us to cherish what we love now, before it or I is ended.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Recovery, Regeneration, Inevitable End</h4>
<p>Painful endings must happen if there is to be regeneration. Do not delay the inevitable. It is best to let things go once they reach a certain stage. If a forceful re-evaluation is presented to you, accept it and look towards the new things that could be happening right where you are. There is a time to stop planning for the better from that point.</p>
