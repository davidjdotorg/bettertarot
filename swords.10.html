<h1>Ten of Swords</h1>
<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>Painful Ending, Loss, Crisis</h4>
<p>You could not expect it, but now here it is. Are you ready for something to hurt bad? If something comes to an end, are you positioned in the memory of the moments? Or are you stuck in the loss? Empathize and express before you share how the loss affects you personally. Make a choice to bring yourself to the conversation with grace and dignity. Do not resist what will happen. Facilitate your own renewal throughout the process. Learn.</p>
<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Recovery, Regeneration, Inevitable End</h4>
<p>Painful endings must happen if there is to be regeneration. Do not delay the inevitable. It is best to let things go once they reach a certain stage. If a forceful re-evaluation is presented to you, accept it and look towards the new things that could be happening right where you are. There is a time to stop planning for the better from that point.</p>
