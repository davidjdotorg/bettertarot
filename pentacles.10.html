<h1>Ten of Pentacles</h1>
<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>Communal Support, Wealth, Legacy</h4>
<p>When you've reached a point of success on your journey, contribute back to the community to feel your true reward. Share your success with others. The blood of my ancestors flows through our veins.</p>
<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Loneliness, Loss, Destruction</h4>
<ol>
<li>Does something feel wrong? Review your finances.</li>
<li>Are you feeling a disconnect with a relationship leaning towards failure?</li>
<li>Do you know what you want? Are you sure this is a shared goal?</li>
<li>If a sense of boredom with life increases, it can lead to taking risks, including emotional ones. Sometimes the risk is justified. Beware reckless behavior!</li>
<li>Calm down. Lead with care. Be available for downgrades.</li>
<li>Do not let your possessions lead your path. Pull what you need behind you.</li>
