<h4>Home, Backbone, Foundation</h4>
<p>When it is over, it is just over. You don't have to be mad. Are you happy it is over? Be the right kind of happy. Then, experience home from within. Look for the end of a difficult and challenging effort. Take this time to find joy, peace and comfort in the completion of the effort. Most thing in life do not come easily. Be proud of what you have acheived. Be in a place of peace, acceptance and happiness. Contentment is not the fulfillment of what you want, but the realizaion of what you already have.</p>
<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Never Drawn</h4>
<p>I have never drawn this card in my life.</p>
