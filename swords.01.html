<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>Clarity, Pure Power, Breakthru</h4>
<p>Cut thru the B.S.! Clearly see the path you want to take. Seek out the truth of matters. Clarity precedes success. Find your breakthru moment. In it there may be a new way of thinking. It takes positive energy to keep up the new way of thinking. Seek out the deeper truths. Ask the questions that lead at face value. Protect yourself and your new ideas. Intellect alone requires emotional involvement to experience pure truth.</p>
<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Confusion, Headcase, Disarray</h4>
<p>A mind is a terrible thing to waste! People offer opinions, but your choices belong to you. Living inside your own mind can taint your view of reality. If you are in the early stages of an idea, decide, dig in and do what you must! The fact is that confusion will reign when clarity is not often sought. Act with precision in your decisions.</p>
