<h1>Ten of Cups</h1>
<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>Wholeness, Connection, Full Circle</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Are you feeling clarity and happiness? Embrace it! Celebrate wholeness in yourself and your relationships.</li>
	<li>Seek out opportunities that align with your personal systems rather than following along.</li>
	<li>Be the support that people need. Work to make family moments enjoyable.</li>
	<li>Loving in full commitment can lead to satisfaction but be clear about your personal beliefs and values.</li>	<li>It is time to 'be' and stop longing for the illusive someone or something better.</li>
	<li>You have the components you need to complete your dream. Take stock and dig in!</li>
</ol>
<p>Are you feeling clarity and happiness? Embrace it! Now is the time to celebrate the wholeness in yourself and your relationships. Work to enjoy family moments. Be the support that people need. Commitment and love can lead to satisfaction. Be clear with your personal beliefs and values. Seek out opportunities that align with your personal systems, rather than following along.</p>
<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Disconnection, Misaligned Values, Relationship Struggles</h4>
<p>You are seeking greater harmony and connection in your relationships. You may feel disconnected and disengaged from a loved one. You may have unrealistic expectations of a relationship. Remember there will always be ups and downs. Through them, you must love and hope to be loved. Think about what being loved means to you. Is that what it means to them? Can you do it? Are your personal values aligned with how you love? Do not allow someone else to decide what will or will not make you happy. Bring your focus back to you.</p>
