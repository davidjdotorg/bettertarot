<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>Wholeness, Connection, Full Circle</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Are you feeling clarity and happiness? Embrace it! Celebrate wholeness in yourself and your relationships.</li>
	<li>Seek out opportunities that align with your personal systems rather than following along.</li>
	<li>Be the support that people need. Work to make family moments enjoyable.</li>
	<li>Loving in full commitment can lead to satisfaction but be clear about your personal beliefs and values.</li>	<li>It is time to 'be' and stop longing for the illusive someone or something better.</li>
	<li>You have the components you need to complete your dream. Take stock and dig in!</li>
</ol>

<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Disconnection, Misaligned Values, Relationship Struggles</h4>
<p>You are seeking greater harmony and connection in your relationships. You may feel disconnected and disengaged from a loved one. You may have unrealistic expectations of a relationship. Remember there will always be ups and downs. Through them, you must love and hope to be loved. Think about what being loved means to you. Is that what it means to them? Can you do it? Are your personal values aligned with how you love? Do not allow someone else to decide what will or will not make you happy. Bring your focus back to you.</p>
