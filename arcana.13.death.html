<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>Change, Ending, Rebirth</h4>
<p>Something is coming to an end. This must happen to bring about something new. Am I in control of the change? If not, am I in control of what could be affected? Clear the clutter by letting go of what is not serving you. Move to a higher plane! Bring in the new, an end in failure need not end in failure!</p>

<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Fear, Uncertainty, Resisting Change</h4>
<p>Certainty gives off a false sense of security. Embrace uncertainty. Let go of what you think you know. Know only what you know. Do not resist the change. The river is not the water yet the water is the river. Address issues to their complete resolution. Do not fear the new. Set yourself on a new journey. Deal with preventions.</p>
