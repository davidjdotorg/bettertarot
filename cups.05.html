<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>Disappointment, Setback, Perspective</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Forgive and move forward with new boundaries to protect yourself. When your joy is the only thing left to steal, hold on!</li>
	<li>When considering your reasons for negative feelings, accept the losses and remember what you have. Spiral up and away from negativity.</li>
	<li>Forgive yourself when harboring resentments. Do not allow that power over you. Review it and release it.</li>
	<li>Don't let people bring you down when they let you down. You are not responsible for their happiness.</li>
	<li>Love that is given is not lost. Give your love beyond the receiver knowing all benefit from a kinder world.</li>
	<li>Find someone to love unselfishly who will appreciate it most. Whatever you do, do it and let go. Lingering in sadness prolongs your oppressor's victory.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Moving On, Acceptance, Forgiveness</h4>
<p>Recover from regret. There are hidden blessings behind obvious disappointments. Seek new emotional outlets. Are you feeling like a failure and are afraid to talk about it? Now might be the time to open up. Find someone you trust. Forgive yourself and move on.</p>
<ol>
<li>Personally say you're sorry.</li>
<li>Personally ask for forgiveness.</li>
<li>Personally be grateful for the moment.</li>
<li>Move on.  Personally MOVE ON.</li>
</ol>
<p>You cannot undo the past. Let go of what doesn't serve you.</p>
