<h1>Five of Cups</h1>

<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>Disappointment, Setback, Perspective</h4>
<p>Are you harboring resentments? Review it and release it. Forgive <b>yourself</b> for allowing someone that power over you. Instead of dwelling poorly in a bad situation, start taking away lessons learned. Consider your reasons for negative feelings. Accept the losses and remember what you have. There is strength in forgiveness. You can forgive and still move forward with new requirements to protect yourself. The only thing left to steal is your joy. Avoid that! Reconcile with regard only to yourself. Create your space in the new environment.</p>

<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Moving On, Acceptance, Forgiveness</h4>
<p>Recove from regret. There are hidden blessings behind obvious disappointments. Seek new emotional outlets. Are you feeling like a failure and are afraid to talk about it? Now might be the time to open up. Find someone you trust. Forgive yourself and move on.</p>
<ol>
<li>Personally say you're sorry.</li>
<li>Personally ask for forgiveness.</li>
<li>Personally be grateful for the moment.</li>
<li>Move on.  Personally MOVE ON.</li>
</ol>
<p>You cannot undo the past. Let go of what doesn't serve you.</p>
