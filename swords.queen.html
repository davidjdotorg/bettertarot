<h1>Queen of Swords</h1>
<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>Clever, Meticulous, Intellectual</h4>
<p>Intellect over everything! Tell it like it is. Let logic rule! Look past hidden motives. Detach from emotions. Use tact. Be cerebral. You are seeking your truth. Call out any boundary-crossers. Put your efforts into your growth.</p>
<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Judgmental, Detached, Bitchy</h4>
<p>Feelings or facts? Look at things with transparency and honesty. Be careful about being too judgmental. Being critical requires facts and logic. You may be thinking more with your heart than your head. You need to be more hard-edged, confident and assertive to complete your missions. Stop ignoring the good things around you. Be committed to compassionate truth.</p>
