<h1>Ace of Pentacles</h1>
<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>Abundance, Manifestation, Prosperity</h4>
<p>You are rich in your relationships, career and family! Holistic wealth abounds. Keep sending the good vibes. New beginnings! Fresh energy! Inspiration! Feel the abundance. Send out positive energy. Do something out of character. Normal things are where magic lies, natural and in civilization. Make nature more comfortable! The advantage goes to the person who is ready.</p>
<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Money Mishaps, Reevaluations, Finances</h4>
<p>Pay close attention to your finances. Reevaluate what's wrong and what's not. Watch out for committing to payments you can't afford. Watch for lost opportunities. Don't move forward until you are ready.</p>
