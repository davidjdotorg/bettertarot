<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Imbalance, Discord, Frustration</h4>
<p>Life can feel off balance, leading to anxiety and stress. Prioritize your activities (passions) to find more joy. Ask for help! Schedule the small steps. Seek incrementalism. Don't get overwhelmed by the big picture. Restore balance and moderation immediately. Lots of energy around, and not much of it is positive. You may have to engage in hard conversations to help clear the air. Combine spontaneity with knowledge. Consider what is appropriate in a situation. Let old habits and old fears die!</p>
