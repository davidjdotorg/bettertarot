<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>Meditation, Contemplation, Evaluation</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Bring your attention inward. Evaluate. Get grounded before you take your next steps.</li>
	<li>Lessen the influence of external forces. Stop trying to be current with the world.</li>
	<li>Seek positive clarity in the present by removing negativity.</li>
	<li>Find new empty spaces within yourself by releasing past hurts and grievances.</li>
	<li>When I am at peace, I am open to new ways to express my love of friends and family.</li>
	<li>Allow your true being to express hir love in material form. This is the best manifestation there is.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Retreat, Withdrawal, Checking In</h4>
<p>Take a moment for some introspection. What is integral to you? What keeps you grounded? Where do you find your calm? What behaviors have you displayed that you wish you could take back? Let those times be the last times. Forgive yourself. Step back into things remembering that you can make yourself the person you want to be.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>Thich Nhat Hanh shares that trees perform no actions to be trees.  They just are trees.  It is in non-action that we are our true selves.  Sit and experience your deepest being in non-activity.  Then, make sure the actions you add reflect your true self.</p>
