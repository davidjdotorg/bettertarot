<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>True Colors, Splendor, Vitality</h4>
<p>Indulge yourself! You feel at ease with life. Live loud and enjoy your creation. Staying true to yourself improves your quality of life. Connect with and replenish your uniqueness. Maintain reality in your environment. Focus your awareness on what you have. Doing so will show you are productive and alive! You have the ability to know things others can only guess.</p>

<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Self-Sabotage, Materialistic Dependency</h4>
<p>You know you were meant for more. Review your core beliefs and change your mindset as required. If you see a lack of discipline, work to correct it now. Do you have abandoned projects or issues that need revisited? Seek useful purposes and channel energy directly towards them. It's hard to know what you want. Would a setback reveal your true desire? Aim for self-awareness.</p>
