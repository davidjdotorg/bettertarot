<h1>Four of Swords</h1>
<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>Recharge, Rest, Contemplate</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Be as silent as you can, so you can hear your own voice, and course correct as needed.</li>
	<li>Stop worrying. Lay down your weapons.</li>
	<li>Give yourself a moment! Take a breather from the chaos around you.</li>
	<li>This is not the time to make decisions. Take action later when seeing with refreshed eyes.</li>
	<li>Seclusion may be necessary. Do it. Withdrawal can lead to healing. Accept help.</li>
	<li>Reroll.</li>
</ol>
<p>Give yourself a moment to breathe! Be as silent as you can, so you can hear your own voice, and course correct as needed. Align back with your values. Stop worrying, lay down your weapons take a breather from the chaos around you. This is not the time to make decisions or take action. Do that later when things are seen with refreshed eyes. Seclusion may be needed. Take a time out. Withdrawal can lead to healing. Be accepting of outside assistance.</p>
<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Depletion, Burnout, Exhaustion</h4>
<p>Stop trying to do it all. Your mind is racing and your body is trying to keep up. You need to rest yourself. Put down your defenses. Take a moment.</p>
