<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>Femininity, Mother Earth</h4>
<p>Be creative! Enjoy yourself! Support the people who are in your life. Spend time in nature. Here comes universal energy. Be the caring self you know you are. Channel your inner goddess. Create beauty in your life. Share it. Get to nature. Open communication pathways. Bring forth with joy!</p>

<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Dependence, Attachment, Fruitless</h4>
<p>How dependent are you on other people's feelings? Don't play waiting games on how someone else reacts before setting things straight for yourself. Work thru your emotions independent of others, then advance as your best self. Are you being overprotective? You are not everyone's fountain or umbrella. Be your own umbrella! Not helping does not always mean you're not helping. Discontented? Feel like something is missing? That could be a creative block. Be patient. Relax. Your intuition is growing!</p>
