<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>Priorities, Balance, Adaptability</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Going with the flow may mean following your systems and rituals closer.</li>
	<li>Life will provide uncertainty. Remain alert, agile and patient while juggling responsibilities.</li>
	<li>Following rituals and systems can bring relaxation. Pay attention to what works. Then, enjoy the fact that it does!</li>
	<li>While getting on top of daily affairs is important when pursuing big goals, you don't have to be busy to be getting things done.</li>
	<li>Every big picture has individual brushstrokes.</li>
	<li>Do you have a mutually beneficial relationship with the items around you? Why do you need what you need?</li>
</ol>

<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Disorganization, Reprioritize</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Get your self together! Are you busy being busy or are you organizing your thoughts and actions </li>
	<li>Are you overcommitted? You are capable of handling things when you apply focused attention.</li>
	<li>This isn't pretend! Do the work when the work needs done and you will be properly busy.</li>
	<li>Time spent analyzing is never wasted. When you act on analysis you improve your environment.</li>
	<li>Your juggling act is likely to fail. You will never find time, you must make time!</li>
	<li>What can I offer to the world that will bring my earthly reward and soothe my soul?</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Quotes</h3>
<p>The wise adapt themselves to circumstances like water to a pitcher.</p>
