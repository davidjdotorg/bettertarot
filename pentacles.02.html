<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>Priorities, Balance, Adaptability</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Going with the flow may mean following your systems and rituals closer.</li>
	<li>Life will provide uncertainty. Remain alert, agile and patient while juggling responsibilities.</li>
	<li>Following rituals and systesm can bring relaxation. Pay attention to what works. Then, enjoy the fact that it does!</li>
	<li>While getting on top of daily affairs is important when pursuing big goals, you don't have to be busy to be getting things done.</li>
	<li>Every big picture has individual brushstrokes.</li>
	<li>Do you have a mutually beneficial relationship with the items around you? Why do you need what you need?</li>
</ol>

<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Disorganization, Reprioritize</h4>
<p>Get your self together! Are you busy being busy? Or are you organizing your thoughts and actions properly? Are you overcommited? You are capable of handling things when you apply focused attention. This isn't pretend! Do the work when the work needs done and you will be properly busy. Your juggling act is likely to fail. Time spent analyzing is never wasted. When you act on analysis you improve your environment. You will never find time, you must make time!</p>

<h3>Quotes</h3>
