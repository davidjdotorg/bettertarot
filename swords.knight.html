<h1>Knight of Swords</h1>
<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>Intense Focus, Opinionated, Action</h4>
<p>When we are obsessed with an idea, we may be blinded by our desire to fulfill it. Then, we can fail to see the difficulties associated with it. You have the strength to succeed. Take quick action and manifest your goals but be willing to accept any fallout. Be assertive to get what you want! Balanced with responsibility and compassion. Either way, your outward energy is displayed.</p>
<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Impatient, Impulsive, Reckless</h4>
<p>Your desire and drive to experience life leads you to make impulsive decisions. Consider possible results without overthinking. You are an independent person free to choose from the beliefs you were taught. When you see someone in the middle of a rash decision, just slow your roll. Your next life lesson could be a solo mission. Be accountable for mistakes made. Think before you act. Meditate! Striking out in a new direction is not charging blindly into the unknown. What is your motivation?</p>
