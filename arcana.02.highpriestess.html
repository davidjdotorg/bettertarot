<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>Intuition, Serenity, Mystery Of It All</h4>
<p>Do not force control! Let the situation unfold as it should. Look inward for your guidance. Trust your expanding intuition. The world is not always as it seems. Continue your journey to the inside. Where can you apply your wisdom now? Can you feel yourself in the universe and feel your place? Are you able to use your own intuition as much as your logic and intellect? Find solitude to help you remain calm.</p>

<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Reconnect, Neglect, Secrets</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Your intuition is your super power! Get quiet and listen instead of thinking and fretting.</li>
	<li>Intuition requires honesty and truth. Are you ignoring something from within that you know to be true?</li>
	<li>Take time to reflect. Meditation allows thoughts to gather. Acknowledge them and move on.</li>
	<li>If you are very busy, can you bring yourself to the busyness?</li>
	<li>Do not let your knowledge block your understanding. Reasoning may require abandoning some of your views.</li>
	<li>It is often an assumption that creates your paranoia.</li>
</ol>
