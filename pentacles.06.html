<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>Giving and Receiving, Flow, Prosperity</h4>
<p>Flow is balanced. You have enough to give. Embrace <b>all</b> prosperity. Live in financial harmony. Do you relate more to the giver or the receiver? Be thankful as both! Do you have spiritual knowledge? Share it with others!</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have much, give of your wealth.</li>
<li>If you have little, give of your heart.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Greed, Debt, One-Sided Charity</h4>
<p>Be wary of being taken advantage of. There is an imbalance somewhere. Are yougiving more of yourself than others are giving you? Support yourself while helping others. Make sure you are giving to yourself! Don't be ashamed of needing back the type of gifts that you give to others. Be careful what you commit to!</p>
<ul>
	<li>If you want money, go to strangers. If you want advice, go to friends. If you want nothing, go to family.</li>
</ul>
