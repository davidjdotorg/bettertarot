<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>Advance, Explore, Prospect</h4>
<p>New world calls out! An enticing path is laid before you, you have a plan of action. You're faced with leaving your comfort zone. "Not all who wander are lost." Know the goal, plan the process, move forward in confidence. It is your world, you command it.</p>
<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Inner Alignment, Fear of Unknown, Lack of Planning</h4>
<p>So many ideas, where to begin? Creative Genius! But maybe no concrete steps forward. Try narrowing your idea down to an action item. You prioritize yourself when you prioritize your passions! My comfort zone may limit my growth. I give myself permission to follow my passion! The night before is just as important as the morning of. Prepare!</p>
