<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>Authority, Ambition, Power</h4>
<p>Maintain your self-discipline. Control your emotions. Make level-headed decisions. Carry out systematic plans. Know the plan! Categorically cast your thoughts. Be very careful your weakness is not your focus. When you are fair, you can be firm. Apply your principles to situations. If you have experience that may benefit those you care about, share it.</p>

<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Domination, Invflexibility, Excessive Control</h4>
<p>Assess your relationship with power, control, authority, responsibility and discipline. Are you giving away your power to please someone else? Seek solutions from personal power. Enable others to to do the same. Others look to you as a leader or an expert and you shy away from the role. Stand up to authority as authority. Commit to your goals with self-discipline and routine. Move towards the pain. Be a specialist.</p>
