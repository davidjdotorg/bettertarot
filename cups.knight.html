<h1>Knight of Cups</h1>
<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>Romantic, Emotional Elation, Adoration</h4>
<p>In tune with intuition, ready for deep conversations, seek out high-spiritedness! Wear that heart on that sleeve! Express yourself openly, you have the emotional support you need. Be open to receive. How will you respond to important news? You are ready to act on some inner feelings. It's okay to move slow and enjoy the ride as a creative process. This is not about a finish line, but a journey. If you are making a decision, consider your feelings.</p>
<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Unrealistic, Jealous, Moody</h4>
<p>Don't let your emotions take you over. Avoid making assumptions or jumping to conclusions. Are you looking at things in your reality or reality itself? What really belongs to you? Don't you know that you can say whatever you want when you know that you've got love in your heart? If you feel yourself getting angry, take a moment and breathe. Exhale all that stuff!</p>
