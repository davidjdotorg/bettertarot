<h1>The Lovers</h1>
<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>Love, Alignment, Choices, Honesty</h4>
<p>Are you flourishing in love? Are you living your core values? What feels best for you? Experience raw honesty and open communication. Get clear with your own values and beliefs. Who do you trust? What is and isn't important to you? Who do you confide in? What decisions are you facing? Are you both giving and receiving authenticity? Conscious connections and meaningful relationships flow out of honest love. Your romantic ties, your close friendships, and your family relationships want your attention! Even and <b>especially</b> if some boundaries are required. Boundaries can be pinnacle to honest love. Stay true to who you are!</p>
<ul>
<li>It is our choices that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.</li>
<li>I love you not only for what you are but for what I am when I am with you. - Roy Croft</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Imbalance, Misalignment, Differences</h4>
<p>It is wise to clearly define what you need from relationships. Do you know what your relations need? Do you see an imbalance? Who most helps you make decisions? Have you decided they should? Speak your truths as reminders of your highest good. Pause and remember how you wish to seem. Now reflect that! Are there traits that you admire in others that you wish you had in yourself? How hard would you have to try to exhibit them? Honor yourself by acting as yourself!</p>
<ul>
<li>Make yourself the person that the person you want deserves!</li>
<li>Don't dream it, be it!</li>
<li>Note: (Inability or Disinclination to Share Thoughts)</li>
</ul>
