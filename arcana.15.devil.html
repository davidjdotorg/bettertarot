<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>Addiction, Enslavement, Fears</h4>
<p>Watch for concerning negative behaviors and patterns that restrain you from moving forward. It is time to realign your core values. Do you now three of your core value? Meditate on each and seek realignment. Doubt may reside within. Look both backward and forward for inevitable events and consider yourself within them. Are you being you? What are the addictions or attachments restraining you from experiencing the freedom of the fool?</p>

<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Awareness, Break Free, Empowerment</h4>
<p>Be open to different ways of living. Eliminate negativity. Watch out for temptations. You may be about to level up. This is a call to higher potential. Deal with your shadows while you can. Daring to understand is living in the light. Review your behaviors while asking what is harmful to your inner psyche. It could be simple standards like healthier eating, better activities, or more focus. Remain faithful to your goal of authentic freedom. What attachments can you drop? If you consider your situation and respond thoughtfully, you can not do wrong.</p>
