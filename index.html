<h1>Intuition Guidebook</h1>
<p>I began writing my own guidebook in March of 2020.  I took a blank journal with 160 pages and wrote the card names across the top.  I finished one and have started others.  Eventually, I was encouraged to put the whole thing online to help others do the same.</p>
<p>These card meanings are the statements and questions I ask myself when referencing the matching tarot card. I have no connection to anything supernatural with tarot cards.  I read the meanings of the cards and write myself challenging thoughts based on the ancient meanings. Apply at your own risk. :)</p>
<p>If you see a card that has 6 sayings or lessons, the idea is to get a 6-sided die and roll it to see which item you can focus on during the day.</p>
<p>I can still be <a href="mailto:tarot@davidj.org">reached via email at tarot@davidj.org</a>.</p>
<p>If you'd like to start your own guidebook, I'd be honored if you used mine as a reference.</p>
