<h1>Five of Pentacles</h1>
<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>Abandonment, Misfortune, Loss</h4>
<p>Are you failing to see help available to you? Do you feel you have suffered a loss? This, too, shall pass! First, level-set. Should you and can you be helping yourself? Make a decision and get, or be, the help you need. Focus on what you have, not what you lack. Do not be afraid of loss. Losses leave open spots to be filled with new things.</p>
<ul><li>The only true security in life comes from knowing that every single day you are improving yourself in some way!</li></ul>
<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Financial Recovery, Spiritual Poverty</h4>
<p>There is something missing inside. Think about your relationship with money, but also your relationships. Persevere now! Your hardships are coming to an end. Look to regain self-confidence. Do you feel like something is completely out of place? Do you know what it is but you can't tell yourself?</p>
<ul><li>Being uncared for is the worst hunger there is.</li></ul>
