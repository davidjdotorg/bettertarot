<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>Illusion, Temptation, Wishful Thinking</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Having what you want does not always mean having a positive result. Be clear with your self that choices bring challenges.</li>
	<li>The images in your mind will be dealt with in reality. Avoid intoxication and escapism.</li>
	<li>Are your ideals realistic? Are your choices real and your own?</li>
	<li>Avoid shiny object syndrome and stay focused.</li>
	<li>Keep your eye on the present, continue to give yourself permission to be fully yourself.</li>
	<li>In our ignorance we believe there is a permanent entity in us, and our pain and suffering manifest on the basis of that ignorance.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Fantasy, Escapism, Diversions</h4>
<p>It's good to imagine but don't be delusional. Bring dreams to reality by taking action. Set your intentions to gain clarity. Ground yourself and reflect on long-term goals. Reduce your options if it helps your vision. You have what you need. What opportunities will be a real benefit to you? Do not chase after pipe dreams. Reflect on what you want for the long term. Do not just settle for someone else being happy.  Be happy they're happy and get happy too.</p>
