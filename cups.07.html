<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>Illusion, Temptation, Wishful Thinking</h4>
<p>Having what you want does not always mean having a positive result. Be clear with yourself that your choices bring new challenges. The images in your mind will be dealt with in reality. Avoid intoxication and escapism. Are your choices illusions? Do you have unrealistic ideals? Time to stop wishful thinking and start taking action. Avoid 'Shiny Object' syndrome. Get focused!</p>

<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Fantasy, Escapism, Diversions</h4>
<p>It's good to imagine but don't be delusional. Bring dreams to reality by taking action. Set your intentions to gain clarity. Ground yourself and reflect on long-term goals. Reduce your options if it helps your vision. You have what you need. What opportunities will be a real benefit to you? Do not chase after pipe dreams. Reflect on what you want for the long term. Do not just settle for someone else being happy.  Be happy they're happy and get happy too.</p>
