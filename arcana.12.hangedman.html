<h1>The Hanged Man</h1>
<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>Sacrifice, Patience, Letting go, Sacrifice</h4>
<p>Hold on. This may be time to delay decisions. Are you able to see the whole picture? When you practice patience, other opportunities may unfold. Is there a tiny thing to put down to help reach the end goal? Accept and surrender to your present circumstance. View things from a new perspective. Give up your attachment to results. Honor the system over the goal.</p>
<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Avoidance, Delay, Indecision</h4>
<p>Stop sacrificing your time and values to please other people. Your life is bigger than this moment! Pause and get perspective. Make space to tune in. Surrender to what is and let go of what should be. Move on with a new mindset. Your perspective should reflect reality. What is racing? Your spirit, body, or mind?</p>
