<h1>Eight of Swords</h1>
<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>Limitation, Confinement, Restriction</h4>
<p>You are ready to grow from your past experiences. You have accepted yourself for who you are. You have complete power over yourself, your past and future. Use it wisely! Create Opportunities and accept life unquestioningly. Commit to action. Do something instead of feeling trapped. Look at situations with new perspectives. Be patient and wait before making rash decisions. You are not the victim just because you are easily offended.</p>
<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Awakening, Liberation, Open to Change</h4>
<p>True freedom comes from simply being yourself! Live your best life by learning from past mistakes. Accept yourself for exactly who you are. Let go of old patterns of behavior or belief systems that have held you back. You have come thru a difficult time. Refuse to be a victim of your own life. You have better examples of what does and does not work, so honor those examples.</p>
