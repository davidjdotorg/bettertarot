<h1>Two of Swords</h1>
<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>Choices, Stalemates</h4>
<p>Do you have a difficult decision to make? Make your decisions with the best intentions. For everybody! Choices don't go away just because they aren't made. Avoidance may lead to greater conflict. Consider a break from your usual way of thinking to help consider alternative ideas. You may have to disagree and commit. When you commit, go wholehearted!</p>
<ul><li>If two choices appear equally good, their outcomes won't be that different.</li></ul>
<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Indecision, Confusion, Overload</h4>
<p>What do you do when a choice you have to make has only negative result options? What happens when you feel like you are playing peacemaker between two people? Slow it down, man, slow your roll! Consider your options carefully. How did you get here? Can you shed the weight of other people's problems? Listen to incoming advice and select the most relevant and helpful parts. Let you guide yourself, driven by your truth. Are there blinders applied?</p>
<ul><li>Boldness has magic, power, and genius in it.</li></ul>
