<h1>The Chariot</h1>
<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>Victory, Willpower, Inner Drive</h4>
<p>Hands on the steering wheel, be ready to go! Your willpower is driving you towards your destiny. Challenges will make you stronger. Maintain Focus! Run your own race and ignore the haters. Leverage opposing forces to your advantage. Be determined, self-disciplined and hard-working. Maintain focus, determination, and confidence in your own abilities.</p>
<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Directionless, Off Course, Roaming</h4>
<p>Sometimes life can 'run you over' with so much drama you find it hard to keep up. Watch out for road rage! If you can feel you could go from zero to one hundred, put the conversation on pause. Get outside and let a destinationless walk remind you how much the journey matters. If there's something you can't control, ride it out without worry or blame or guilt. Focus on the thing that matters most (usually love!). Make sure your attitude and energy aligns with your passions and your boundaries. Stop claiming power you do not have; Build what you need!</p>
