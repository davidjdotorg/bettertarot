<h1>Queen of Cups</h1>
<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>Intuition, Compassion, Openness, Calm</h4>
<p>It is all about kindness. Listen to people and respond with compassion. Allow things to flow freely. A tender heart can heal past wrongs. Keep your emotional needs as a priority. Allow self expression from everyone. Tune into what others are feeling. Reflect with their feelings. Empathize with others. You are here to support and to teach others, by drawing upon your intuition and sense of calm and your emotional connectedness. Be a safe harbor. Uphold the boundary between yourself and others. Do not lose your sense of self, that's what people need. Sense the emotional currents without diving in.</p>
<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Restriction, Delusion, Overemotional</h4>
<p>You may have bought into your own reality. So much so that you have expectations of things or others that do not reflect ehir reality. Create healthy boundaries and seek your true feelings. Draw your emotions inward and focus on your emotional well-being. Are you fostering dependency so you feel needed? Reconnect with your intuition and tune in to your voice. Find a peaceful space to center and calm your soul.</p>
