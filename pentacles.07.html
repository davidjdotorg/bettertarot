<h1>Seven of Pentacles</h1>
<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>Vision, Perseverance, Reward, Patience</h4>
<p>Seek out long-term rewards and practice patience daily. Wasted efforts for quick results can be heartbreaking. Recognize what saps your energy. if you have been working on something, take a step back and review your efforts. Money is a hard lesson. Try to control it without it controlling you. Loving without reciprocation is like work with no reward. If it isn't your very own passion, is it worth it?</p>
<ul><li>
Live your life each day as you would climb a mountain. An occassional glance towards the summit keeps the goal in mind but many beautiful scenes are to be observed from each new vantage point. Climb slowly, steadily, enjoying each passing moment, and the view from the summit will serve as a fitting climax for the journey. (melchart)

<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Wasted Effort, Restructure, Low Return</h4>
<p>Lack of Long-Term Vision. Research your next move and then act. Create a system to automate your financial decisions. Investing can also mean time. Prioritize! There is a pervasive dissatisfaction, a trapped feeling, that comes from unsatisfying leadership. Do you know when to stop investin in something that brings low returns? Take stock of what you still need to do to get where you want to be.</p>
