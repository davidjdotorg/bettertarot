<h1>Seven of Wands</h1>
<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>Attack, Challenge, Persevere</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Recognize imposter syndrome. You are meant to be where you are.</li>
	<li>Not everyone will like you, but you must maintain your integrity.</li>
	<li>When you stop trying to please everyone, not everyone will be pleased.</li>
	<li>If your effort is fulfilled to the point of acclaim, you must accept competition and challenge.</li>
	<li>Stand up for yourself. Prove you are alive and fire runs thru you!</li>
	<li>Your acts of devotion to your own form of expression is all the rebel you ever need to be.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Territorial, Loss of Power, Overwhelm</h4>
<p>Controlling everything does not give power. Are you over-committed? Are you backing down too easily? Release what doesn't serve you. Comparing yourself to others may leave you feeling inadequate. Do not avoid conflicts that result in growth. You are up to the challenge!</p>
