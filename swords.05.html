<h1>Five of Swords</h1>

<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>Self-interest, Survival Mode</h4>
<p>Even though you may have won the argument, you are in danger of losing your relationships and reputation. This need to be right is inflating your ego, driven by a fear of losing control. Even though you think you won, you may end up the loser, because you have hurt others and have isolated yourself. Not all is well when the battles end. If you live passively, you are in for a struggle. Are you prepared for problems? Is the price of winning worth the reward? Would you accept defeat? If so, why battle?</p>

<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Amend, Conflict, Forgive and Forget, Open to Change</h4>
<p>Tension drains your magic. Release the tension, protect your magic. Your opinions are validated by YOURself. Go in and move out. Be authentic. Who do you need to be right with? Begin negotiations. Disregard the opinions and see the human in front of you. Not everyone will share your joy of living your life. To thine own self be true, in a loving and caring way.</p>
