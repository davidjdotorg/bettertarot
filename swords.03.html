<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>Heartbreak, Rejection, Pain, Separation</h4>
<p>The most painful lessons define our character. Prepare yourself for loss. Past pain is a learning opportunity. Is there a choice in your future? Did you just make a choice? What are you disappointed about, if anything? Expressing or feeling sadness is part of the healing process. Stay focused on recovery as you deal with damage. Make it count. Find hope, self-love, forgiveness and time. Don't accept other's conclusions as your truth.</p>

<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Forgiveness, Releasing Pain, Optimism</h4>
<p>The past still lingers in the shadows, haunting your memories with remorse. What once was just was. Forgive yourself and those who hurt you to cleanse out sadness and bring in joy. You are doing your best to leave things behind. Accept situations and work towards the betterment. Be the peacemaker. Avoid mental alienation. Be here now.</p>
