<h1>Ace of Cups</h1>
<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>Creativity, Free Flow</h4>
<p>You are being offered refreshing opportunities; Enjoy them! Pour out your feelings! Give more, get more. You may be weary of a current state. Look for new friendships. Who do you enjoy being with or talking to? Freely give. Be comfortable with who you are. Think for a moment on what comes naturally to you, then let yourself do it. You can bring happiness to others by living your life on your terms. Find the spark! Create an open and safe space for all to express themselves and how they feel. No feeling is forever if it can't be felt. Let your love be like the misty rains, coming softly but flooding the river! </p>
<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Release, Emotional Exhaustion</h4>
<p>Let it all go, man! Show yourself some self-love. Really tell it all. Find constructive ways to express your feelings. Do a check-in on your emotional health. When you are thinking, what are you feeling? Knowing your feelings will help you understand your thinking. Have you responded in wrath when you could have been calm? Facing problemsn head on doesn't have to be violent. Listening to yourself, finding your right behavior, and responding in kindness is how peace gets into every step.</p>
