<h1>Five of Wands</h1>
<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>Competition, Rivalry</h4>
<p>Being seen and heard is everyone's desire. If you want that for yourself, you must be willing to do that for someone else. Only you know what's best for you. Are you in the middle of tension? Is it impacting your ability to move forward? Everyone fights to be heard but who fights to listen? Take a moment and listen! Tune in to others! Find a constructive environment to test yourself and weigh yourself against others and your own opinion!</p>
<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Avoid Conflict, Compromise, Truce</h4>
<p>In the act of avoidance, one tends to scatter their energy. Prolonging conflict can make it worse. Choose your battles. What are your internal conflicts? Who do you know with strong views? Sometimes there is no right answer, just the answer that is right for you. Align your head and your heart to find your truth. Stop avoiding!</p>
