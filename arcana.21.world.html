<h1>The World</h1>
<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>Completion, Integration, Accomplishment</h4>
<p>Find an acceptance of yourself and others that creates unity. Expect movement. If you haven't finished something, examine the loose ends. Are you able to walk newer, open paths? Are you in the right place, doing the right thing, seeing your vision and feeling fulfilled? Can you see your role in the systems at play around you? Accept a sense of wholeness. You are in the right place doing the right thing. Celebrate that! Don't rush on to something new just yet. Enjoy the moment. Think globally.</p>
<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Not Drawn Yet</h4>
<p>I have not written a page for this card. I have not drawn it yet in my weekly pull.</p>
