<h1>The Sun</h1>
<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>Positive Vibes, Warmth, Radiance</h4>
<p>Find simple moments. May success and abundance find you on your terms. There is energy to tap into from the sun. People are drawn to you because you see the bright side. Keep being warm. Share your highest qualities with others. Radiate who you are. Connect to your power base. Express yourself authentically. Be fully present in the world around you. Recognize how deeply you can feel and then allow yourself to do so.</p>
<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Temporary Depression, Lack of Success</h4>
<p>Finding the positive aspects to a particular situation may prove to be difficult. Setbacks may have damaged your enthusiasm. Because it's the sun, it's temporary. Your perception of a particular situation may be overly optimistic. You do not have a good sense of yourself and what you can or can't do. Get some open feedback. Things may seem cloudy. Recognize that and perform within it. It will only get harder to stay positive as you get older and feel the negative effects of aging. Fight hard.</p>
