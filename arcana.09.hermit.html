<h3>Upright</h3>
<h4>Soul Searching, Reflection, Truth</h4>
<p>Seeking truth tends to be a solo journey. You define your core values. Align your body and mind. Consciousness desires to move inward; Let it! Honor the wisdom within yourself. What do I have that is only mine?</p>
<ul>
<li>Realing your mind's potential thru introspection and contemplation gathers self-confidence.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reversed</h3>
<h4>Loneliness, Confinement, Withdraw</h4>
<p>Connect with your higher self. Evaluate your priorities. You are not alone. Create more space to reflect. Where is your inner voice? Create more time and space to listen to you. This is not an exercise in sorting out what to do next, it is only not doing right now, then hearing from yourself. Have you heard from your calm self lately or is your angry self holding the narrative? Rebuild yourself from your right self. Let that self dictate the time you spend alone and how you spend it. If you have something to share, share it gently.</p>
